Description: Computes exact coverage fractions for polygon-grid intersections
    and returns results in a sparse two-table format: run-length encoded
    interior cells and individually weighted boundary cells. Evolving from
    the dense-matrix approach (gridburn) toward a pure scanline sweep that
    is O(perimeter) in memory. Uses the exactextract algorithm by Daniel
    Baston, vendored from the 'exactextractr' package.
